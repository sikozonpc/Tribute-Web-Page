# Tribute-Web-Page
My first Responsive Web Page, from the freeCodeCamp.org course.

## You can see the website in action here:

## The project:
This website is a tribute to Dr.Carl Sagan , an idol of mine.

Also, this my first finished responsive web page after completing the HTML & CSS basic course from https://learn.freecodecamp.org/ .

With this project I've learnt how to make images and other content responsive to diffrent screens sizes and how to structure and develop a basic website.
